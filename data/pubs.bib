   abstract = {During 2017 and 2018, we collected the quantity of questing black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis), also known as deer ticks, in 124 sampling sites of 5m by 5m in four state parks—Caumsett State Historic Park, Connetquot River State Park, Rockefeller State Park, and Fire Island National Seashore—around New York City. The black-legged tick is the primary vector for the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, the pathogen of Lyme disease, in Northeastern United States. Using the flagging method, we collected and counted the numbers of adult and nymphal black-legged ticks at each stie. Along with these quantities, we also recorded the geographic coordinates, ambient temperature, and relative humidity at the sampling sites. Using high-resolution aerial imagery and LiDAR data, we further derived land cover composition, ecotone boundary length, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, solar radiation, and other environmental factors. The data could be used to conduct longitudinal analysis at the same sampling sites as well as comparison with other sites. Ecologists and environmental scientists can use the data for spatiotemporal and statistical analyses of tick ecology at the local scale.},

   abstract = {Agent-based models (ABMs) have been established as a valuable research tool in the study of complex human-environment systems. However, it is still challenging to produce generalizable and practical results with ABMs for theory development. We use the case of the effects of “neighborhood” size on urban sprawl to illustrate the practice of generating and testing general conclusions from ABMs. In agent-based urban land-change models, homebuyer agents assess land utilities with a bundle of attributes including the quality of focal or zonal neighborhoods. The size of such neighborhoods, or more precisely the spatial assessment units (SAUs), has significant impacts on simulated urban patterns, yet this sensitivity of modeled impacts has not been validated with empirical evidence. Using an ABM that features markets and competitive bidding, we explored how the neighborhood or SAU size affects urban development patterns under various scenarios of homebuyer preferences, which produced a consistent finding that bigger SAUs tended to generate more sprawled patterns. To bring this finding to the real world, we evaluated relationships in data between sprawl indices in US metropolitan areas and the average sizes of their school districts—one type of real-world SAU in neighborhood delineation and a strong input to homebuyers' assessment of housing quality. While the finding has practical policy implications for urban planning and public education, this case exemplifies a path for simple ABMs to support empirically grounded theory development.},

   abstract = {Exploring the intellectual heritage of urban geography in North America (UGNA) is a valuable but daunting challenge. One practical way is to mine the written narratives about its key figures and to map the pattern of their interconnections within a historical and institutional context. Urban Geography in America, 1950?2000: Paradigms and Personalities, a book edited by Berry and Wheeler, permits such an approach. In this book, twenty-five authors primarily documented their study, research, and career experiences. Using the ties among these authors along with those who influenced their research, this article discovers, maps, and interprets the interconnections among notable U.S. urban geographers. These ties were constructed as a social network, and network analysis techniques were applied to examine the structure of the community as well as the evolution of the discipline. This analysis presents a particular view on the roles that individuals, programs, and periods played in the development of twentieth-century UGNA. Explicitly mapping the UGNA community helps geography students and scholars better understand the discipline?s intellectual heritage, historical landscape, and evolutionary trajectory.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACTAutomatic production of contiguous area cartograms has become practical with computer algorithms, particularly applying forces to rubber-sheets and simulating diffusion processes. Reformulating the existing force-based and rubber-sheet methods, this article presents a fast and flexible force-based computational framework for general space transformation with solid physical and mathematical foundations. When being applied to cartogram production, this framework guarantees topological integrity, allows flexible force generation, achieves fast convergence, and avoids extreme shape deformation. Benchmarked against the recently published fast flow-based diffusion method using five datasets of various volume, compactness, and complexity, this force-based framework is faster, reduces more shape deformation, and can produce cartograms with distinctive slim or inflated styles. Additionally, the force-based framework is robust and can handle complicated datasets, whereas the flow-based method produces errors from them. Although the flow-based diffusion method often reduces cartogram size error more than the force-based (typical weighted mean error is below 0.1% versus 1%), both are outstanding with such low levels of error and their cartograms generally register little visual differences. Overall, the force-based transformation framework provides a fast, flexible, and robust alternative to the diffusion method for cartogram production.},

   abstract = {Measuring the form and structure of geographic landscapes is fundamental to understanding geospatial phenomena and their dynamics. Shape compactness metrics have been extensively employed in gerrymandering assessment, urban planning, landscape ecology, and other applications. Existing compactness measurements for gerrymandering, however, target particular aspects of gerrymandered shapes such as elongation, indentation, or dispersion without adequately integrating them with spatial context. This article proposes a comprehensive shape compactness metric that coherently integrates these aspects. It first divides a district into nonoverlapping maximum inscribed circles. Then Euclidean distances from the centers of these circles to the district centroid are standardized and regulated using contextual and topological factors like the distribution of attributes, the fixed upper level boundary, and the relationships with other districts. Finally, these regulated distances are aggregated to produce a quantitative compactness measure that, unlike most existing ones, features a threshold for gerrymandering identification and the coherent integration of roundness, convexity, closeness, and spatial context. Applying the new metric to the U.S. Congressional districts exemplifies its differences from existing metrics and also illustrates the necessity and value of coherently combining multiple aspects of gerrymandering in a single shape compactness metric.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACTMapping spatial flow remains a challenge despite noticeable progress in recent years. This article presents a new, automated layout algorithm for spatial flow from one origin to multiple destinations. The algorithm triangulates the mapped space and builds a network from the triangles. It then simulates the formation of the dendritic drainage pattern of natural river systems and constructs an approximate Steiner tree by sequentially computing the shortest paths from the origin to the destinations using dynamically decreasing edge costs. A series of automatic cartographic operations, including edge simplification, straightening, smoothing, and rendering, then follow to improve the esthetics of the tree and to produce flow layouts that feature natural clusters and smooth edges. An experimental evaluation using four examples illustrates the effectiveness and adaptability of the algorithm with various spatial and parameter configurations. A quantitative comparison with existing methods on esthetics shows that the new algorithm generally renders destinations farther away from tree edges, which helps improve map readability but at the cost of longer total tree length. Evaluated with a smoothness index that rewards gradual tree splitting and smooth, natural, and straight edges, the proposed algorithm can achieve higher average edge smoothness and avoid the least smooth edges under various parameter settings.},

Despite progress in computer algorithms for visualizing general hierarchical data, mapping spatial hierarchical regions, especially with static, noninteractive means, still requires considerable manual efforts. This paper proposes a two-step algorithm that can automatically recommend perception-based colors and help reveal the hierarchical structure embedded in nested regions. It first systematically sorts regions according to their contiguity and containment relations at multiple hierarchical levels. Then, perception-based colors are generated using the order of regions with the goal of maximizing differentiability between top-level regions while retaining the perceived uniformity of the bottom-level regions. With the coloring scheme recommended by this algorithm, the metric color differences among regions mathematically reflect their hierarchical positions and spatial relations. The resultant colors, therefore, can potentially help map-readers perceive the spatially constrained hierarchy structure built in nested regions.},

Global food commodities trade is worth more than US$520 billion per year, could feed approximately two billion people, uses about 13% of worldwide cropland and pasture, and has geographically concentrated irrigation water demands. However, researchers rarely compare these monetary, nutritional, and resource metrics, which limits our ability to holistically evaluate the drivers and implications of trade. We found that each metric suggests distinct conclusions about the geography of globalized agriculture. For example, traded animal products have a disproportionate influence according to value-based and embodied pasture metrics. Traded wheat, soybean, and maize contain the most calories, use the most cropland, and strongly influence irrigation water consumption. We typify engagement in trade by assessing how countries allocate cropland to domestic versus foreign demand. Simultaneous consideration of multiple metrics could enhance decisionmaking surrounding trade by capturing the complex biophysical and economic context of agricultural globalization.},

   abstract = {Land-use change in a market economy, particularly at the urban?rural fringe in North America, is shaped through land and housing markets. Although market activities are at the core of economic studies of land-use change, many market elements are neglected by coupled human?environment models. We scrutinized the effects of the level of detail of market representation using an abstract, agent-based model of land-use change. This model includes agents representing land buyers and sellers and their respective market-based decision-making behaviors. Our results show that although incorporating key market elements, particularly budget constraints and competitive bidding, in land-use models generally alters projected land-use patterns, their impacts differ significantly depending on the level of detail of market representation. Consistent with theories of land change, our research confirms that budget constraints can considerably reduce the projected quantity of land-use change. The effects of competitive bidding, however, are more complex and depend on buyers? budgets, their relative preferences for proximity versus open-space amenities, and the size of neighborhoods. Market competition might reduce or increase the quantity of land-use change and the degree of sprawl in the simulated landscapes. Because of the strong effects of market elements on resulting patterns, adequate representation of the structure of markets is important for capturing and characterizing the complexity inherent in coupled human?environment systems.},

   abstract = {Urban land-use modeling methods have experienced substantial improvements in the last several decades. With the advancement of urban land-use change theories and modeling techniques, a considerable number of models have been developed. The relatively young approach, agent-based modeling, provides urban land-use models with some new features and can help address the challenges faced by traditional models. Applications of agent-based models to study urban dynamics have increased steadily over the last twenty years. To offer a retrospective on the developments in agent-based models (ABMs) of urban residential choices, we review fifty-one relevant models that fall into three general categories: (i) urban land-use models based on classical theories; (ii) different stages of the urbanization process; and (iii) integrated agent-based and microsimulation models. We summarize and compare the main features of these fifty-one models within each category. This review focuses on three fundamental new features introduced byABMs. The first is agent heterogeneity with particular attention to the method of introducing heterogeneity in agents' attributes and behaviors. The second is the representation of land-market processes, namely preferences, resources constraints, competitive bidding, and endogenous relocation. The third is the method of measuring the extensive model outputs. In addition, we outline accompanying challenges to, and open questions for, incorporating these new features. We conclude that, by modeling agent heterogeneity and land markets, and by exploiting a much broader dimension of output, we will enhance our understanding of urban land-use change and are hopefully able to improve model fitness and robustness.

   abstract = {This article presents a fast, free-form rubber-sheet (Carto3F) algorithm for the construction of contiguous area cartograms. Rubber-sheet algorithms are influential and popular because of their conceptual simplicity. Existing rubber-sheet algorithms, however, tend to be algorithmically inefficient and computationally slow. More critically, they cannot completely preserve topology. Carto3F specifically improves rubber-sheet algorithms in these two aspects. First, with a spatial structure of quadtree and a mathematical condition for topological equivalence, Carto3F can prevent topological errors and guarantees topological integrity. Second, Carto3F is designed with efficiency as a priority. Its efficiency is primarily gained through using the auxiliary quadtree to reduce the number of points to be transformed. Furthermore, Carto3F allows parallel computation and can fully take advantage of the increasingly common multi-core, multi-thread processors. Based on the mathematical analysis, Carto3F also mitigates the effect of force cancellation that is inherent in rubber-sheet algorithms. On a computer equipped with a 2.4-GHz quad-core CPU, Carto3F can produce quality population cartograms of the United States, China, and the world within 1 second, 18 seconds, and 8 minutes, respectively. Quantitative measures show that Carto3F outperforms the optimized rubber-sheet algorithm and the diffusion algorithm in both transformation effectiveness and computational efficiency.},

   abstract = {This paper presents the conceptual design and application of a new land-change modelling framework that represents geographical, sociological, economic, and ecological aspects of a land system. The framework provides an overarching design that can be extended into specific model implementations to evaluate how policy, land-management preferences, and land-market dynamics affect (and are affected by) land-use and land-cover change patterns and subsequent carbon storage and flux. To demonstrate the framework, we implement a simple integration of a new agent-based model of exurban residential development and land-management decisions with the ecosystem process model BIOME-BGC. Using a stylized scenario, we evaluate the influence of different exurban residential-land-management strategies on carbon storage at the parcel level over a 48-year period from 1958 to 2005, simulating stocks of carbon in soil, litter, vegetation, and net primary productivity. Results show 1) residential parcels with management practices that only provided additions in the form of fertilizer and irrigation to turfgrass stored slightly more carbon than parcels that did not include management practices, 2) conducting no land-management strategy stored more carbon than implementing a strategy that included removals in the form of removing coarse woody debris from dense tree cover and litter from turfgrass, and 3) the removal practices modelled had a larger impact on total parcel carbon storage than our modelled additions. The degree of variation within the evaluated land-management practices was approximately 42,104 kg C storage on a 1.62 ha plot after 48 years, demonstrating the substantial effect that residential land-management practices can have on carbon storage.},

   abstract = {The neighborhood is the central analytical entry point into a wide range of research topics, but it is an open question as to what defines a neighborhood. Most quantitative neighborhood classification methods are based on the assumption that neighborhoods are composed of places with similar spatial and socioeconomic characteristics. While this assumption is both convenient and valuable in neighborhood classification, it tends to overlook critical features of lived experience, particularly human activities such as migration. This paper examines neighborhood classification through the lens of migration patterns in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area of Minnesota. This study uses a parcel dataset to derive a near complete depiction of intraurban migration, which is then coupled to a new combination of methods informed by migration concepts to construct and analyze neighborhood structure. The results of this approach illustrate the value of combining data, method, and theory of human migration in neighborhood classification.},

   abstract = {Urban sprawl is shaped by various geographical, ecological and social factors under the influence of land market forces. When modeling this process, geographers and economists tend to prioritize factors most relevant to their own domain. Still, there are very few structured systematic comparisons exploring how the extent of process representation affects the models’ ability to generate extent and pattern of change. This chapter aims to explore the question of how the degree of representation of land market processes affects simulated spatial outcomes. We identify four distinct elements of land markets: resource constraints, competitive bidding, strategic behavior, and endogenous supply decisions. Many land-use-change models include one or more of these elements; thus, the progression that we designed should facilitate analysis of our results in relation to a broad range of existing land-use-change models, from purely geographic to purely economic and from reduced form to highly structural models. The description of the new agent-based model, in which each of the four levels of market representation can be gradually activated, is presented. The behavior of suppliers and acquirers of land, and the agents’ interactions at land exchange are discussed in the presence of each of the four land-market mechanisms.},

Agent-based modeling in turn advances complexity science by actuating many complex system characteristics, such as self-organization, nonlinearity, sensitivity, and resilience. There are many points of contact between complexity and agent-based modeling, and we examine several of particular importance: the range of complexity approaches; tensions between theoretical and empirical research; calibration, verification, and validation; scale; equilibrium and change; and decision making. These issues, together and separately, comprise some of the key issues found at the interface of complexity research and agent-based modeling.},

   abstract = {There is mounting interest among scientists regarding the use of scientometric social network analysis, or quantitative analysis of the evolution of science as defined by individual researchers and the networks they form. Given that geographers have seldom used this approach compared to researchers in other fields, its implications for research and policy need to be assessed. We applied scientometric social network analysis to geographic information science (GIScience) to understand how the field has evolved over the last sixteen years and to assess the applicability of the standard logistic model of the growth of scientific disciplines. In particular, we examined collaboration in the field at multiple scales, namely, the evolution of the entire research network structure, the nature of subnetworks in defining geographic information science, and the roles individuals play within the community. By delineating how collaborations and research networks have evolved in GIScience, the study addresses the potential of scientometric social network analysis for geography.},

While analog parcel information has long been available, the move towards digital georeferenced data offers a more readily available means of using detailed structural and land use information. Parcels map onto useful units of analysis such as individuals and households, and serve as the foci of policy institutions tasked with functions such as taxation, schooling, zoning, or public health. The promise of digital parcel data is offset by challenges related to format, availability, maintenance, quality, augmentation, and confidentiality. We examine the use of digital parcel data in research and policy with special reference to land use, public health, education, and environmental applications. We also make recommendations for improving and using parcel datasets.},
