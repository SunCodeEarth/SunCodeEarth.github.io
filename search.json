    "text": "Abstract from the publication\n\nMapping spatial flow remains a challenge despite noticeable progress in recent years. This article presents a new, automated layout algorithm for spatial flow from one origin to multiple destinations. The algorithmtriangulates themapped space andbuilds a network from the triangles. It then simulates the formation of the dendritic drainage pattern of natural river systems and constructs an approximate Steiner tree by sequentially computing the shortest paths from the origin to the destinations using dynamically decreasing edge costs. A series of automatic cartographic operations, including edge simplification, straightening, smoothing, and rendering, then follow to improve the esthetics of the tree and to produce flow layouts that feature natural clusters and smooth edges. An experimental evaluation using four examples illustrates the effectiveness and adaptability of the algorithm with various spatial and parameter configurations. A quantitative comparison with existing methods on esthetics shows that the new algorithm generally renders destinations farther away from tree edges, which helps improve map readability but at the cost of longer total tree length. Evaluated with a smoothness index that rewards gradual tree splitting and smooth, natural, and straight edges, the proposed algorithm can achieve higher average edge smoothness and avoid the least smooth edges under various parameter settings.\n\n\n\n\nSun, S.

    "text": "Abstract from the publication\n\nMapping spatial flow remains a challenge despite noticeable progress in recent years. This article presents a new, automated layout algorithm for spatial flow from one origin to multiple destinations. The algorithmtriangulates themapped space andbuilds a network from the triangles. It then simulates the formation of the dendritic drainage pattern of natural river systems and constructs an approximate Steiner tree by sequentially computing the shortest paths from the origin to the destinations using dynamically decreasing edge costs. A series of automatic cartographic operations, including edge simplification, straightening, smoothing, and rendering, then follow to improve the esthetics of the tree and to produce flow layouts that feature natural clusters and smooth edges. An experimental evaluation using four examples illustrates the effectiveness and adaptability of the algorithm with various spatial and parameter configurations. A quantitative comparison with existing methods on esthetics shows that the new algorithm generally renders destinations farther away from tree edges, which helps improve map readability but at the cost of longer total tree length. Evaluated with a smoothness index that rewards gradual tree splitting and smooth, natural, and straight edges, the proposed algorithm can achieve higher average edge smoothness and avoid the least smooth edges under various parameter settings.\n\n\n\n\nSun, S.

I teach Geographic Information Science, GeoInformatics, and Spatial Data Science related courses and also develop and apply spatial analysis and modeling techniques to explore our networked world.\nThe complexity generated by and embedded in the connections, relatedness, interactions, and interdependence among places, environments, and societies requires new thinking, new theories, and new analytic methods for a sustainable world. It also makes interdisciplinary, planned and unplanned cooperation a necessity in all natural and social sciences but particularly human-environmental and geographical sciences. Network analysis and agent-based modeling, powered by geocomputation and GeoAI, are methodological frameworks that can be adopted to visualize, analyze, and simulate the pattern and complexity in these interactions. It is particularly promising, sometimes discouraging, but always challenging to integrate the population, economy, and ecology across spatial scales by capturing and modeling their relations and interactions using networks and the virtual laboratory of agent-based models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth America in great universal geographic map (Kun yu wan guo quan tu)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York City Skyline \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vibrant Urban Landscape\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithms for Geovisualization and Spatial Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuturistic Cityscape Envisioned by AI\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope my research, teaching, and service as an academic and my pursuit of eco-friendly lifestyle as a cosmopolitan citizen could make a tiny but positive contribution to the greatest collective efforts ever to build a sustainable planet for the nine billion people living on the Earth in the near future.\n\n\n\n“By our theories you shall know us”\n\nA well-known quote from David Harvey, explaining why the following “theories” or ideas are on the home page.\n\n\nAcademic conventions divide up the seamless web of the real social world into separate spherers, each with its own theorising. … It is wise to bear in mind that such a conventional cutting of reality is at best just a convenience of the mind. … Subdivisions of social knowledge thus may roughtly correspond to the ways in which human affairs are organized in particitular times and places. They may, accordingly, appear to be increasingly arbitrary when practices change.\n– Robert W. Cox (1981).  Social Forces, States and World Orders.       \n\n\n\n\nThe value of complexity exists in the eye of its beholder. For some it is merely a passing fad, for others an interesting complement to accepted conceptual frameworks, and for others it is a pioneering break from a moribund Newtonian worldview. …. Complexity offers a host of new approaches to the study of economic, political, social and environmental systems.\n– Steven M. Manson (2001).  Simplify Complexity: A Review on Complexity Theory       \n\n\n\n\nHousing activity—households using dwellings—forms a central feature in the human use of the earth. A house is a structure; a home is an experience. Housing is an interactive process with meanings tied to status, social position, wealth, power, aspirations, and personal identity.

    "text": "Abstract from my recent agent-based land use change modeling publication\n\n“Land-use change in a market economy, particularly at the urban–rural fringe in North America, is shaped through land and housing markets. Although market activities are at the core of economic studies of land-use change, many market elements are neglected by coupled human–environment models. We scrutinized the effects of the level of detail of market representation using an abstract, agent-based model of land-use change. This model includes agents representing land buyers and sellers and their respective market-based decision-making behaviors. Our results show that although incorporating key market elements, particularly budget constraints and competitive bidding, in land-use models generally alters projected land-use patterns, their impacts differ significantly depending on the level of detail of market representation.

    "text": "Abstract from my recent agent-based land use change modeling publication\n\n“Land-use change in a market economy, particularly at the urban–rural fringe in North America, is shaped through land and housing markets. Although market activities are at the core of economic studies of land-use change, many market elements are neglected by coupled human–environment models. We scrutinized the effects of the level of detail of market representation using an abstract, agent-based model of land-use change. This model includes agents representing land buyers and sellers and their respective market-based decision-making behaviors. Our results show that although incorporating key market elements, particularly budget constraints and competitive bidding, in land-use models generally alters projected land-use patterns, their impacts differ significantly depending on the level of detail of market representation. Consistent with theories of land change, our research confirms that budget constraints can considerably reduce the projected quantity of land-use change. The effects of competitive bidding, however, are more complex and depend on buyers’ budgets, their relative preferences for proximity versus open-space amenities, and the size of neighborhoods. Market competition might reduce or increase the quantity of land-use change and the degree of sprawl in the simulated landscapes.
